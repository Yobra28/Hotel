# Smart Hotel User Flow Guide

## Overview
The Smart Hotel system has been streamlined to provide clear, distinct user flows for different types of users while eliminating redundancy.

## User Types and Access Paths

### 🏨 **Landing Page** (`/`)
**Purpose**: Main entry point for all users

**Navigation Options**:

- **"Guest Login"** → Guest Login (`/guest-login`) 
- **"Staff Login"** → Staff Login (`/login`)

### 👥 **Guest Users**

   - Direct login if already registered

2. **Guest Registration** (`/guest-register`)
   - Multi-step registration form
   - Room booking integration
   - Account creation for guests

3. **Guest Login** (`/guest-login`)
   - Dedicated guest login interface
   - Clean, hospitality-focused design
   - Automatic redirect to guest dashboard

4. **Guest Dashboard** (`/guest-dashboard`)

   - Complete feature set:
     - Overview with statistics

### 👨‍💼 **Staff Users**

## **Current System Architecture**

```
